   - Files are saved in the `output` directory

## Environment Variables

For Windows, you might need to set these environment variables:

```
TESSDATA_PREFIX=C:\Program Files\Tesseract-OCR\tessdata
POPPLER_PATH=C:\path\to\poppler\bin
```

## Troubleshooting

### Tesseract Issues

1. **"Tesseract not found" error:**
   ```python
   # Add to the top of app.py:
   import pytesseract
   pytesseract.pytesseract.tesseract_cmd = r'C:\Program Files\Tesseract-OCR\tesseract.exe'  # Adjust path as needed
   ```

2. **Poor recognition quality:**
   - Ensure PDF scan quality is good
   - Check if correct language files are installed
   - Try adjusting image preprocessing (contact maintainers)

### PDF Processing Issues

1. **PDF import fails:**
   - Verify poppler installation
   - Check if poppler is in PATH
   - Try with a different PDF to rule out file corruption

2. **Memory errors with large PDFs:**
   - Try processing fewer pages at once
   - Ensure sufficient system memory is available
   - Close other memory-intensive applications

### Export Issues

1. **Unicode characters missing in output:**
   - Verify file is opened with UTF-8 encoding
   - Check if appropriate fonts are installed
   - Try a different text editor

2. **WeasyPrint PDF generation fails:**
   - Verify all WeasyPrint dependencies are installed
   - Check system font availability
   - Try updating WeasyPrint to the latest version

## Limitations

- Very large PDFs (>100MB) may require additional memory
- Recognition quality depends on input scan quality
- Processing time varies based on PDF complexity and system specifications

## Development

### Running Tests
```bash
python -m pytest tests/
```

### Code Style
```bash
# Install development dependencies
pip install black flake8

# Format code
black .

# Check style
